Project: *Boggle the Mind*

Goal: Recreate a web version of the popular game [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle). Make it a 4 x 4 grid with each consonant repeated 3 times and each vowel repeated 6 times plus a random choice of three more vowels added, totaling 96 choices (i.e. 16 dice * 6 sides).  Choose the letters with a random choosing function.  Add a 3-minute timer.

Extra features:
1 - create a sand timer
2 - Allow for 5 x 5 or 6 x 6 grids
